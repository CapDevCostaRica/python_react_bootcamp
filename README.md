# Important notes

In the repository, you will find an .env.example Please copy it and rename the copy to .env; this will load environmental values for Docker.

From there, you can run:

```
docker-compose up
```

If you added a new module or a new dependency remember to run

```
docker-compose up --build
```

On the first run, and if you haven't changed anything in the .env file, you can visit http://localhost:4000 and receive a random motivational phrase; your setup is working.

If you need to reset your DB maybe you switching apps, then run

```
docker-compose run flask_app bash /app/run_local.sh reset_db
```

If you created a local environment and installed the requirements, you can reset the DB from your host as well

```
python backend/framework/scripts/reset_db.py
```

## Building Your Own Flask Application

**For regular bootcamp participants who want to build their own apps:**

Create a folder under contributors with your username. In there, you can make a new folder to create a new module, and inside that folder, create two files:

```
main.py
requirements.txt
```

Then, go to .env and change APPLICATION_FOLDER to your module, e.g., "capdevcr/health". Now, restart your Docker and your application should be running.

If you plan to use Alembic, ensure that your alembic.ini file and folder are located in the root of your module. Additionally, you can create a seeds.py file that will run when Docker starts to populate your database. You can check framework/seeds.py as an example.

You should use a centralized database.py config file as we do on the framework for your app.

## Running Tests

### For Testing Workshop Participants (Comprehensive Testing Strategy Session)

**No contributor folder needed!** Workshop materials are ready to use in the Docker container:

```bash
# 1. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Start Docker environment
docker-compose up --build -d

# 3. Access the container
docker exec -it python_react_bootcamp-flask_app-1 bash

# 4. Inside container, run workshop test examples
pytest examples/test_examples.py -v

# 5. Explore workshop materials
ls examples/     # Test examples with intentional failures
ls exercises/    # Hands-on D&D monster service exercise
ls templates/    # Ready-to-use fixture templates
```

### For Regular Bootcamp Development (Building Your Own App)

When building your own Flask application (not the testing workshop):

```bash
# Access container
docker exec -it python_react_bootcamp-flask_app-1 bash

# Navigate to your module (requires contributor folder setup)
cd contributors/your_username/your_module

# Create and run your app-specific tests
mkdir -p tests
cd tests
pytest . -v --cov=.. --cov-report=html
```

## Accessing bash

If you need to access bash to run any commands, just use:

```
docker-compose exec flask_app bash
```

## Creating database migrations

This will only work for apps created using backend/contributors/capdevcr/boilerplate

After updating the `backend/contributors/your_username/your_app_name/app/models.py` adding or updating the table(s), follow the next steps:

1. Ensure docker is running with the containers from this project.
2. Go to `backend/contributors/your_username/your_app_name`.
3. Execute `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "some-meaningful message"`
4. Optional: review the file created under `backend/contributors/your_username/your_app_name/alembic/versions`
5. Run `alembic upgrade head` to execute the changes on the DB.
6. Optional: if you need to downgrade for some reason your change (instead of just recreate the image/container ðŸ¤¯), run `alembic downgrade <hash-from-upgrade-cmd>`

## (Deprecated) Creating database migrations the legacy way

After updating the `backend/contributors//models.py` adding or updating the table(s), follow the next steps:

1. Ensure docker is running with the containers from this project.
2. Go to `backend/framework`.
3. Execute `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "some-meaningful message"`
4. Optional: review the file created under `backend/framework/alembic/versions`
5. Run `alembic upgrade head` to execute the changes on the DB.
6. Optional: if you need to downgrade for some reason your change (instead of just recreate the image/container ðŸ¤¯), run `alembic downgrade <hash-from-upgrade-cmd>`

## Spining up localstack along with your app and database
You'll see this is your `.env.example` file:
```
COMPOSE_PROFILES=None|localstack
```
To enable `localstack`, set it like this:
```
COMPOSE_PROFILES=localstack
```
To disable `localstack`, set it to:
```
COMPOSE_PROFILES=None
```
